# wp-cli-git-helper

Adds the `wp gh` command, which is a wrapper for `wp [plugin|theme] [update|install]`.

## Huh?

One common workflow for managing a WordPress site through version control is to keep the entire codebase - WP, themes, and plugins - under version control. On this setup, updating third-party plugins and themes can be tedious, since updates may be frequent, requiring lots of commits and commit messages. `wp gh` does this work for you, by composing a commit message and performing the commit.

## Installing This WP-CLI Package

The following steps to install this package for WP-CLI were added by [Vital](http://https://github.com/VitalDevTeam).

1. Find your active php.ini file: `php -i | grep php.ini`
2. Edit that file and increase `memory_limit` to `512M`
3. Restart Apache
4. Install package: `wp package install boonebgorges/wp-cli-git-helper`
5. By default, the package's path to `autoload.php` will be wrong. Open the package's main file: `/Users/your_user/.wp-cli/packages/vendor/boonebgorges/wp-cli-git-helper/wp-cli-git-helper.php`
6. Change line 4 to: `require '../../vendor/autoload.php';`

## Totally Sweet and Customizable Features

None to speak of. This is a tool I've built for my own workflow. It assumes that you keep your entire WP installation in the same repo. It assumes that you like the commit message format I've chosen. It does not support core updates (yet). Some things I will eventually add:

* Ability to override the commit message, either by passing it directly as a `--commit-message` param, or perhaps by drafting a commit message and then sending you to `$EDITOR`.
* Support for `wp core update`.
* Proper `delete` support.
* Support for the `--all` flag.
* SVN support (jk!)
